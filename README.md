# Plant Notes

Andy is doing work on the plants. They are currently visible to projector 2, which maps to Display 2 when running the game.

To avoid conflict in the scene, the plant manager is stored as a prefab and instantiated into the scene when the game starts. You can find it in `Assets/Plants/PlantsManager`. Go there to change settings for the plants.
